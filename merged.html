                    <!--<h4>13 Reasons Why</h4>-->
                    <p>
                        There was a lot of controversy surrounding this show because it's core revolves around teen suicide.  A lot of people said it glorified suicide through graphically explicit scenes of the act.  Others say it's an important show because it brings up the conversation and issues of suicide.  I stand somewhere in-between.  This show definitely is not for everyone.  I think you need to be in a stable state of mind to sit through this to prevent any adverse effects it may have on you.  The show as a whole was pretty slow and boring.  The high school drama was too over-personified and I found a lot of it to be bogus.  Regarding the heavy issues, I think it succeeds in creating a conversation, but I think the explicit graphics could have been left out and the same result would have been achieved.  Even I, lover of all things gorey, felt uneasy watching Hannah's suicide.

                    <p>These were my favorite books as a kid so of course I had to watch this series.  I wasn't sure what to expect with NPH as Count Olaf because I could not envision him in the role.  Overall, I didn't like this show.  I think casting could have been a lot better.  The only redeeming quality was the cinematography and over-the-top bizzare sets/background props.  I enjoy the movie a lot more than this series.</p>

                        After watching Westworld, I watched some cast interviews and saw that James Marsden could sing.  Then furthering my research, I stumbled upon him singing in Ally McBeal, and WOW.  When he sang You Are Always on My Mind I lost it.  I also saw that Lucy Liu was in this show so that was another inch forward.  However, I didn't get to watch it for a while because I'm lazy and don't want to go link by link.  But after getting Hulu, I saw it had the complete series available and so I began.  I'm not crazy about it, but I definetly see the appeal.  Also, I learned this was one of the first shows to feature a lead female, so I of course, will always support anything driving up gender equality.

                        Everyone said this is the best season so I went in with high hopes.  I did enjoy it a lot more than Murder House and Freak Show.  But no way does it beat Coven in my book.  Best character was Sister Jude of course.  I don't understand how Jessica didn't get the Emmy. THIS SCENE RIGHT HERE IS MY FAVORITE EVER.  I WILL EVEN SAY IT'S BETTER THAN STEVIE'S SCENES IN COVEN WHICH IS SAYING A LOT.  I guess this is what happens when your creator and producers also made Glee.

                        So I've tried watching Asylum and Murder House before and they were okay.. I wasn't hooked on it.  But I fell into a deep Fleetwood Mac/ Stevie Nicks hole one day and saw she was in Coven.  It was on prime video so I watched it.  I loved it immediately.  First they were playing a ton of Fleetwood Mac and Stevie songs.  And Misty was bascially the biggest Stevie stan.  I really loved this quote she said "Stevie didn't really find her voice until she and Lindsey joined Fleetwood Mac.  That's the thing. Can't be your best self till you find your tribe.  I'm still looking for mine." That really resonated with me because all my life I've never found people that I fit with and never had any friends I felt comfortable enough around to be  my true self.  Aside from this, Jessica Lange is amazing.  I am highly considering watching all the other seasons because of her alone.  Angela Bassett was also killer in this.  Both of them together on screen created a beautiful and powerful dynamic.  I can't believe Kathy Bates got the Emmy over Angela Bassett.  PURE CRIMINAL.

                        So this is Jessica's favorite season ever.  I liked this season because Jessica sings so much.  I also surprisingly really liked Dandy.  He's as psycho as they get but there's some charm in it that gets you.  And a lot of his scenes were just blood baths (he literally had a scene where he bathed in a pool of blood) which we all know the bloodier and gorerier the better.  Finn is also a really good actor, I've only scene him in Secret Life, but that show never gave him an opportunity to show his true potential.

It deals with heavy personal topics such as domestic abuse, rape, and adultery. And the finale and ultimate message of women banding together and helping each other is all I could ever want in this world.  Also the Monterrey scenery and music in this show is to die for.  </p>

                    I started this show after I rewatched One Tree Hill for the bajillionth time and during that I forgot how much I loved Brooke Davis.  I felt some sort of Sophia Bush withdrawals so I started this show. I was a bit hesitant because it was just announced that she was departing after 4 seasons. However, being the fucking masochist I am, I started it anyway (which was a pain because I started a Hulu subscription to watch it but soon discovered that they only had the 4th season on Hulu so I had to watch season 1-3 using other means). The first episode was surprisingly good.  Going into the show I was expecting the same ole procedural police drama. It is a procedural show, but I was not expecting them to shoot that chick in the face in the first episode and kill her. After that I was sold. I don’t know if it’s Sophia but I love Erin Lindsay so much. She has the same compassionate and caring nature for people as Brooke did, and also has the capabilities of being a badass cop and putting people into their places when needed. I also did not expect to like other characters as much as I do. I really like Voight (his voice is super cool too) and Halstead of course. But what really kept me going was Linstead. I DIE. AND NOW THAT SHE’S LEAVING THE SHOW I AM GOING TO BE INCOMPLETE. This is the first time I’ve seen a premature Selena’s curse. She left before I even started the show.. The show got really sloppy near the end of the 4th season and her departure was absolutely terrible. I have a sliver of hope that she will at least be back in the first episode of the 5th season to wrap up Linstead and Erin, but I don’t want to get my hopes too high. I love Erin and Linstead, but Sophia spoke in a recent podcast about the toxic work environment and I don't blame her for departing. Things must have been super bad because she worked with Chad for years after their divorce.  So as much as having no more Erin or Linstead makes me sad, nothing is worth Sophia suffering.

It's another one of those shows you watch only when you're bored and don't really go out of your way to watch it. I'm not super invested so I picked a random picture..</p>

                    <!--<h4>Daredevil</h4>-->
                    <p>This is a Netflix original and Marvel, so of course I had to watch it. If you aren't familiar with Daredevil, he's a part of the Marvel Universe.  He's a blind human that fights crime. Season 1 was okay, I wasn't super crazy about it because I didn't really love any of the characters.  But Season 2 blew me out of the water.  Mainly because of this guy in this picture.  Frank Castle AKA The Punisher.  Can I just say I was really doubtful that I would like him because of Jon Bernthal's protrayl of Shane Walsh in TWD (WHO I HATED TO PIECES).  But Jon's some sort of amazing and gave this character such redeeming qualities and made me just love him.  I also love Elektra in season 2 and her relationship with Matt. </p>

                    <p>This show was also recommended by my cousin, and I remember watching it every Sunday right after Breaking Bad when they were still airing.  I love this show.  I loved the gore element and the idea of a murderer of murderers.  I liked this show so much that I even listened to podcasts about it after each episode. Truth be told, I am still pretty upset over the ending. I just loved the kills and the mystery of the entire series.  He typically has one main villian/enemy each season so the crime isn't solved episode by episode like a lot of shows.  This picture is of the Morgan siblings, Dexter and Debra.  They are the best. </p>

                    <p>After listening to Eva Longoria on the Unqualified podcast I decided to give this show a shot. It's such a mom show.  But we know I love those. The pilot was shockingly good. I always thought it was a full on drama, but the show has comedic undertones tied to the drama. It's 8 seasons long, and people raved about it so I decided to pick it up. I was originally in search of more diversely casted shows, but this show is pretty much all white with the exception of Eva.  However, this show is female dominated, and lead so it is also very much acceptable in my eyes.  You know I'm always here for more strong female characters and relationships. </p>

                    <p>A long time ago I watched 1 episode of Doctor Who.  With the 9th doctor and Rose.  I hated it... Fast forward a few years I give it another shot but with the 11th and Amy Pond.  I decided to give it another try only because I had just finished Selfie and just loved Karen Gillan in it and I knew a lot of people loved her in this as well so I dove in. I adored 11 and Amy's relationship.  AND ANGELS OF MANHATTAN BROKE ME.  I BAWLED SO HARD OH GOSH.  My heart still hurts just thinking about it.  Those are the best shows in my book.  The ones that still make you feel pain whenever you think of them.  This picture is from Angels of Manhatten and of 11 and Amy being cute.</p>

It definitely is a different vibe than BBC Sherlock.  I kinda got left behind in the dust after season 3 because I had too many shows to keep up with. This is Sherlock and Watson</p>

It's about a family that owns a record company named Empire and of course there's family drama that follows.  So the woman in this picture is Cookie Lyon, and she went to jail for a crime and is back and wants her claim for her portion of it.  I still have to catch up on the latest seasons</p>

                    <p>A pretty typical MTV teen show that you only watch because you're bored. High school drama. But there's sort of a twist because the main character Amy is in love with her best friend Karma, and the school thinks they're dating so they fake it to be popular.  And stuff happens.  It got canceled.  This picture is of Karma and Amy and I don't really remember what was happening.</p>

                    <p>I watched this because I love the parent series, The Walking Dead.  And it has ADC in it so I was convinced enough.  It definitely is not TWD. It's more of the early stages/days of the zombie apocolypse and it gives a different persepective and vibe to the whole scenario.  I definitely don't love a lot of the characters like in TWD.  I only like Alycia so here's a picture of her.</p>

                        Jessica Lange.  I watched this entirely because of her and I wanted to see if she had a chance against Nicole in Big Little Lies for the Emmy.  It was a slow start but by the end I got really into it.  Prior to watching, I knew nothing about Joan Crawford or Bette Davis.  But going back and watching some youtube compilations of the scene comparisons between the show and the actual movies of Bette and Joan blew my mind.  It was an absolute crime that this show got nominated for 18 Emmys and went home with 0.  SNUBBED to no end.  If you watch the side-by-side comparisons, it's truly remarkable at how accurate it is.  Jessica was incredible but she ended up losing to Nicole. :(

If you're not familiar with From Dusk Till Dawn, it's loosley based off the movie with the same title.  And it follows the Gecko brothers, Seth and Richy.  Then stuff just happens because they're criminals and there's vampires.  This is a picture of the pilot where the Gecko bros fuck shit up. Still haven't caught up with anything after season 2 episode 1..  But I do miss DJ Cortona's pretty ass face.</p>

                    <p> I never loved a show as much as I do this one.  This show is unlike any other I’ve ever watched (which is a lot).  All the characters’ journies/struggles and their complex relationships with each other.  The production value is on an entirely different level than your standard TV shows, each episode is an absolute masterpiece. Perhaps what I love most is the battle for power and all the schemes and wars that result. I am loyal to House Targaryen but I also like the Starks.

And the strongest thing this show has is the mother-daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory.  They created a beautiful dynamic between these two and not having much of a relationship with my own mother, I longed for this. The ending killed me. Shipping-wise, I am one of the few that like Rory and Logan. I really don’t see what people see in Jess.. I also hate Lorelai and Luke and prefer her with Christopher. l0l.

It had it's moments but most of it I wished didn't happen.. Good things were: Logan got the most screen time out of all of Rory's boys.  Logan and Rory had beautiful moments. Logan calls Rory Ace still. Emily Gilmore is a badass.  Richard Gilmore tributes tugged my heart. Bad: Tossed out everything that Rory and Logan stood for in the original series.  Logan would never reduce Rory to a side chick. The Logan in the original stood up for her even against his own family from the start.  There's no way he would just roll over and agree to an arranged marriage for his family.  I don't like how they made Rory pregant in the end.  That just ruins everything.  Why would they go to all this work to make Rory like Lorelai?  She's not. I'm not sure if I want another season and give them a chance to fix things or I can just pretend it never happened. This picture is of Rory and Logan of course.  It was my favorite scene and episode.  Fall.  The life and death brigade were back at it again. Everything was beautiful.

I was so obsessed I called myself gleena and I have never changed my URL since. I think this show was so easy to love because of the cast and music.  I remember watching each episode as it aired a minimum of three times the first night.  At some point, I was able to identify which song belonged to which numeric episode, season, and title of the episode. Quinn Fabray was my favorite and I quit when she left.  Due to this, she was subject to Selena’s fave curse (in which they all die or are written off terribly).  I loved Faberry, Quinntana, The Unholy Trinity, Fuinn, and Quick.

                        Watched this because I saw ads for it on USA.  It's about a group of federal agents that live together in a house.  There's people from FBI, DEA, and ICE. And just the drama/crime with that.  It's pretty good.  It got canceled after the 3rd season, which I've yet to watch.  This is Paige and Mike.

                        I got into this show pretty late.  It was after Derek had already died so maybe 10+ seasons were already out?  It was all on Netflix so I didn’t care how long it was and just committed.  I swear with each hospital drama my deep buried desire of being a doctor just grows.  I never realized the multiple divisions and specializations in surgery until this show.  Cristina and Meredith’s relationship was the best part of this show.  The whole idea of a person is something I’ve always wanted.  Besides that relationship, I really liked Derek and Meredith as well and still cried like a lil bitch when he died (DESPITE KNOWING IT WAS COMING). And still after 13 seasons now and many main cast rotations, I still thoroughly enjoy this show.

It's based off Hannibal Lector from Silence of the Lambs.  He's cooking sequences are freaking stunning. Great amount of gore and bloody kills too.  This is him in his kitchen.

I think I get a lot of that from House.  I loved watching this show because of the puzzle behind every diagnosis and I was able to live my doctor dreams. I also learned a lot medically from this show. This is 13 and House my favorite characters.

It's very smart like Game of Thrones and all their politicing.  I love when Frank breaks the 4th wall.  Kevin Spacey was born for this role and he's now one of my favorite actors now because of this.  This is Frank and Claire smoking. OTP

                        Okay, so I first gave this show a try when Maisie recommended it. I didn't continue because I was lazy.  But since this is on Amazon Prime Video I am much more inclined to watch it.  So I got back into it after reading the Crazy Rich Asians series.  Gemma Chan is cast as my favorite charater Astrid Leong!  She also happens to be the lead in this show so I wanted to see her acting.  This show is a British series.  It's about android robots that are widely available for consumer purchase, and the robots perform every day household duties.  It's very Westworld-esque (well I guess Humans came out first..but I watched Westworld first) in the way the robots are created from actual humans and they have moments of conciousness and realization.

This show tries to be inclusive with diversity, but I found it more insulting than inclusive. Okay, you depict a gay couple, a multiracial latina/white male, and and adopted Asain child. This show has these characters, but they way they are portrayed is very mockingly. They gays are extremely over exaggerated. The Latina always has to act dumb. Sad I gave this show 4 seasons before I realized how bad it was.

                        Another show I watched as a kid.  Having rewatched this recently, it’s pretty amazing how relevant it still is.  I find it reeeeaaaallly funny that I liked Peyton and Lucas as a kid, and watching as an adult I fucking despise both of them.  Brooke Davis made this show.  She carried this show for 9 seasons. Naley were in it till the end as well, but they got boring after a while.  Brooke is probably my top favorite female character of all time.  I truly wish there were more Brooke Davises in the world, and I aspire to be one.  Her success, drive, kindness, and compassion are what I love most about her.  Not to mention she had the best character development I’ve ever seen. This probably explains why I hate Peyton and Lucas so much.  Because they fucked Brooke over and treated her like complete trash.  She was constantly crying on the show (probably because Sophia Bush has a beautiful cry face), and it constantly made me cry seeing her cry.  She had the biggest heart ever and didn’t deserve all the shit she went through.  She deserved everything she wanted and more.  I really do hope one day I can have a heart like hers.

It's about a family and their problems with Autism, adoption, affairs, and just about anything you can think of that happens in families.  I remember at one point I was crying each week because of the episodes.  They really know how to get to your emotions.  This is Team Braverman in the finale.

                        I don't remember why I watched this.  It's about the parks and recreation department in Pawnee, IN.  It's a comedy so I wasn't too crazy about it.  I still have yet to finish the last season.  I love Ann and Leslie the most so that's why the image is of them.

                        I remeber watching a random episode on ABC family one day because they had a marathon for it.  It was pretty good so I decided to start from the beginning and catch up.  It's about a group of girls who's friend died and an anonymous person named A is tormenting them.  I felt they were beating a dead horse.  The series/plot has been dragged out too long.  Thankfully they announced that the next season will be their last becaues it should have ended a while ago.  This is Hannah and Emily my faves, mostly because of Buttah Benzo.

                        I heard good things about this show and it was on Hulu so I had nothing to lose really.  After the pilot I found myself surprisingly enjoying this show.  It's about 3 siblings that try to reboot their father's sugar cane farm after he dies.

It's funny beacuse I think the show got cancelled because of the concept. It's about a bunch of sick/terminal (if I remember correctly??) kids in a hospital and I don't think anyone wants to watch something that depressing sounding.  Which sucks, because I thoroughly enjoyed this show.</p>

                        I first started this show after seeing gifs of 1x02 where Francis and Mary are watching Charles and that other girl.  I was like “who are these beautiful ass people???”  So then I started watching it and it ruined my life.  FRARY.  I LOVE FRARY TO DEATH. I completely lost it when Francis died.  The show really was not the same without him.  I am satisfied with the ending and glad that for once my OTP survived (well they died but they’re together lol) and are happy together. I love Frary to death. THEY BREAK MY HEART. OTP FOR LIFE.

I gave it a shot and unfortunately CW got me again because I loved it.. I never read the comics so I could care less how accurate or not it is.  I love Veronica and Betty the most.  Betty and Veronica is OTP, but I'll settle Veronica and Archie.  And unlike most of the fandom,  I'm not too big on Betty and Jughead.

                        I first saw this because it aired right after Graceland on USA.  I loved it ever since the pilot. It's about a doctor that helps unconventional patients, normally super rich folk that abused drugs, or had some dumb accident and are now caught in some medical bend.  This show had so much potential and it destroyed me when it got canceled.  2014 pilot season really was bad for me.  This and Selfie both got axed.  And I'm pretty sure it's because both were named poorly.

                        Where has this show been my entire life?? I typically am not too fond of comedies and I hardly ever laugh or enjoy most of them.  This show is the perfect comedy for me.  I love the dark/black comedy it has.  And I love the gore element of it.  It's about a suburban family, and the mother turns into a zombie somehow.  There's just a bunch of bizaree situations and scenes.  I love it.  I legit laugh out loud which is very very rare.  This is one of my favorite screencaps.  I just love their faces.

The thing I liked most is probably how they depict Sherlock's thought process while he solves the mystery.

The episode where they’re walking and he saves her from a car is my favorite.  I’m still sad that they didn’t crossover in Skins Fire and Rise. WOULD OF BEEN PERFECT.

                       I saw Adam Brody randomly in an interview on Youtube and he hasn't been in anything in a while so I checked it out.  He was promoting this show.  I was a bit conflicted with whether or not I wanted to watch it because it also had Martin Freeman in it.  And it is a tech and drug and crime drama.  So everything I love in one.  This is a prime example of how love can trump hate.  Because I still watched this show despite hating that fucking actor.  It was really good because he actually wasn't that annoying.  It's about a cryptocurrency startup and their journey to get funded.  It's a whole roller coaster and there are so many twists it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

                        If you know me.  You will know that I am not a fan of cartoons/animated series. I just find it too difficult to connect with drawings, and not actual people.  One of my faves, Jacob Anderson/Raleigh Ritchie/Greyworm, covered a song from this show on the uke, and I couldn't get the tune out of my head.  In addition to this, I recently watched an interview of him talking so highly about this show.  On top of that, it was on Hulu, so I decided to give it chance.  To my surprised, I actually enjoyed it.  I really love the songs in the show and the lessons taught.  Also why didn't anyone tell me Estelle was in this!??!!

                       Season 1 Review:
                       This is a Netflix original.  It was super hyped up so I was expecting really great things from it.  But that didn't really happen.  It moved really slow for me, and was only semi-redemptive near the last 3 episodes.  It's about a kid that gets lost in some other dimension. I don't really get why people are crazy about it.  It was probably only a 7/10 at best for me.  Maybe sci-fi isn't my thing.  This is a picture of the kids.  Dustin is my fave.  He's the cutest.
                       UPDATE SEASON 2 REVIEW:
                       Season 2 was a lot more enjoyable for me. I liked it a looot. Kinda reminds me of Daredevil where I season 1 did nothing for me but season 2 blew me away. I've always liked Steve ever since season 1 and he way upped himself this season. HE DESERVES THE WORLD AND MORE!! Nancy how could you break his heart?? Honestly, I think reformed Steve and Nancy are a million times better than Jonathan and Nancy. I never got the appeal with Jonathan, but I guess they are dating in real life so there's that. Nancy redeemed herself at the end because she danced with Dustin. Also this season, I found Dustin to be a lot more annoying and stupid. He still had some good moments though. I also found Mike to be my favorite kid this season. He didn't really do much, but his qualities as a friend and being there for Will got to me. True loyalty. The horoscope thing did say Mike Wheeler is a Cancer. I believe it.

It had Carly Chaikin in it too so that was good.  I only watched half of the first season so far. This is a random picture and I'm not too sure what's happening.

                       I watched the pilot when it first came out, but I never had a chance to keep up with it as I was always preoccupied with school and other shows.  And it wasn't amazing enough for me to make the effort to watch it.  But recently over winter break when I renewed my Netflix, season 1 was on it and I saw a lot of gifs of Lena Luthor so I was like okay I gotta see what all this fuss is about.  AND OH MY GOD. THIS IS LENA LUTHOR. She should be a main cast member jfc.  I don't know how anyone even ships Kara/Supergirl with anyone else but her. EVERYTIME THEY ARE ON SCREEN TOGETHER IT'S SO GAY. LIKE THEY COULD NOT BE MORE IN LOVE LOL. Yeah, I basically love Lena.

                       I'm not too sure why I started watching this.  But boy am I glad I did.  This show is about a teenage werewolf. The first few season are super good.   My heart hurts a little every time I think of this show.  Scallison.  I quit after Allison died. I NEVER GOT A FUNERAL FOR HER.  I remember watching the episode and I screamed and cried because it was so unexpected.  I NEVER THOUGHT MY BABY WOULD DIE.  Her and Scott were made for each other and it was too difficult to watch the show runners try to fill her with all these different chicks, so I quit. I told you the Selena Curse is real. This is Scallison, my heart and soul. They had a beautiful love and I still cry every day because of them.  OTP 4 LIFE.

                       I tried to watch this show a few years ago and I hated it.  I only got 15 minutes in before I had to quit.  The acting and line delivery was extremely cringy.  I couldn't take it.  And there was no star actor to keep me in, they were all new faces.  I came back to try it maybe 1-2 years after since it was on Netflix and I was bored.  I gave it another shot and it actually got better.  After the first few episodes things actually start happening and picking up.  It's about a post-apocalyptic society where they live on a huge spaceship but they are running out of resources.  So they send 100 juvenile delinquents to Earth to see if it is liveable again.  This is Raven my favorite.

                       I first heard of this show when I saw the trailer for it on Youtube.  I had no idea why some girls were yelling at a subway.  I thought it was a horror or something at first.  I didn't think anything of it.  But I saw it on Hulu one day and decided to give the pilot a shot.  It wasn't that good.  I actually quit for a few weeks.  But boredom got the best of me again and I watched the second episode. Then the third...and all the way till I was caught up.  It's still actively airing it's first season, but I'm pretty surprised.  It definetly has some really moments.  I, of course, love the strong female leads, and the relationship that Jane, Sutton, and Kat have. And here I thought I was done with ABC Family/Freeform stuff.

                       Ever since the trailers for this, I was always interested in watching it.  It's a period drama about the British Monarchy, Queen Elizabeth II's rise as a ruler in particular.  This show is a very slow burn.  I'm not sure where all the critical acclaim comes from for all of it's Emmy nominations and Golden Globes, because I found it pretty bland..  I honestly don't think Claire Foy is that great in this.  She doesn't have a lot of strong moments like most leads do, and most of the time her character is pretty dry.  John Lithgow as Winston Churchill however was phenomenal. The costumes in this show are amazing as well.

                        I love Marvel x Netflix, AKA Jessica Jones and Daredevil (at times), and I was super hype for the team up.  I never watched Iron Fist or Luke Cage, and I'm glad because Iron Fist is annoying as hell.  I really really loved the dynamic they created between Jessica and Matt. I died because I love Elektra and Matt together, and when she was curled on his bed trying to remember it broke my damn heart.  Also the Trish and Jessica moments were the best.  There were very few but they were so good.  I love them so much ugh. It was so short though, only 8 episodes.  Such a tease.  It got me really hyped up for more Jessica Jones though because she was the best character in this show.

                       I do love superhero shows and Grant Gustin so I was down to watch this.  It's definitely on the lighter side of the spectrum in terms of how dark superhero shows can get sometimes. This is Barry and Iris.  I know they are canon in the comics so hopefully this ship goes my way this time.

I love Polaris.  She is my favorite. Emma is one of my new faves because she is amazing as Polaris. The weak points in this show are the Strucker fam.  I find them so boring.. The show should be focused on Polaris or the mutant underground. I think that would be a lot more interesting than focusing on your average American family. With focus on the mutants you get to see more powers, their struggle with acceptance in society, as well as a more diverse cast.

This show allowed me to live my buried lawyer fantasy dream.  I liked how it was about a mom returning back into the workforce after having kids and being away for so long.  This was the first law drama I watched and I loved it.  Will and Alicia make me sad.  Also Matt Czurchy doesn’t age and still looks like lil baby Logan from Gilmore Girls. I am also still upset about the ending.

                        This Hulu original got Emmy nominations and I got a Hulu subscription so I gave it a shot. This show is pretty dark and heavy.. A lot of the situations were very uncomfortable to watch.  I loved the cinematography and use of color in this show.  A lot of scenes were just beautiful.  The story is about a woman that gets kidnapped and is now a handmaid.  Handmaids are the few remaining that can still concieve children.  So this society of mostly upperclass and high ranking officials are assigned their own handmaid.  And essentially the handmaid lies between the husband and wife in order to concieve children.  It's pretty disgusting.

So of course they were subject to the Selena Curse.  I still cry at her death.  For many years, I had a tradition where I rewatched this up until season 4 (after Marissa dies) every spring break.   This is Ryan and Marissa, I loved them together so much.  I CRY AND AM SO SAD AND BROKEN OVER THEM STILL.

                       The creator of this show is the same of One Tree Hill.  Initially I found this show to be pretty trashy, which was expected because it aired on E!. But somehow I persisted and found it is actually pretty damn good.  Eleanor makes this show for me.  I think it’s because she reminded me so much of Effy from Skins.  Funny thing is I absolutely HATED Jasper in the beginning, but now I love Jasper and Eleanor.  The birthday episode where she’s crying and he’s watching from the doorway and James Bay is in the background is still my all time favorite scene.  UGH SO GOOD.

But somehow I finished season 1, and I might even watch season 2 if I'm bored enough..

                       I'm not sure why I watched this either.  I think maybe tumblr?  This show is about the supernatural.  There's vampires, werewolves, and witches.  They like never write in their diaries ever again after season 1 so don't expect any of that.  This is Stelena.  Stefan and Elena.  They are my OTP 4 LIFE.  I don't understand why people like her with Damon. I just don't see it.  The scene where Stefan calls Elena on her birthday ruins me every single time I watch it.  It touched my heart, grabbed it out my chest, crushed it, and stuck it back in.

                       I watched this because my cousin recommended it to me.  I mostly watched this for the gore.  I love the kills and the zombies.  I have also grown attached the the characters and their journies.  It's really good. This is Rick Grimes.  He's crazy and I love it.

                       I first watched the pilot because it was free on iTunes.  It was okay, nothing crazy enough for me to continually keep up with it.  After all the Emmy buzz and praise it got, I continued it (because it was on Hulu).  Everyone said this show will make you cry every week.  I only cried once the entire season.  And that was only maybe 2 tears.  It was at this scene, where Kevin leaves his opening night and goes to Randall's office.  That's something this show excels in, the portrayl of Randall as a person who has his life together, seemingly perfect, but underneath it all is full of flaws and vulnerabilities. I don't know how this show got all the award buzz it did, because Parenthood was x92955349 more better as a family drama.  During Christina's cancer arc, I cried every freaking episode in that show.  That show didn't get any buzz because it was too rednecky probably, and probably because it lacked the superstar team of actors this show has.  Although, I am only ever impressed by Sterling K. Brown in this show.  Mandy Moore, and Milo Ventimigalhoweveryouspellit are just average.  Overall, I found this show was too overrated.

                       I watched this because I was bored.  I'm still only on season 1.  This show is about vampires and humans living in the same world.  There's a lot of problems between the two species.  It reminds me of the X-men  human and mutant relationship. That's funny because Ann Paquin is in both.  SO this picture is from the finale and it's a super spoiler for myself so haha.

                       I feel this show is what Jane the Virgin seeds from.  In the sense that both do a good job of highlighting the Hispanic heritages of both female leads with hints of telenovella styles. I really love the set of this entire show.  The Mode office is probably my favorite, I just love the avant-gardeness of the office.  And putting Betty in that scene juxtaposes it even more.

                       I watched this because it won Emmys. I'm not too keen on comedies, but this show manages to make me laugh.  It's about the vice president of the united states, and they poke fun at politics.  It helps that the main character has the same name as you. Also JLD is absolute gold.  This is a random picture since I wasn't too sure which to put.

                    I watched this because it was on Netflix and I was bored.  It's a pretty similar plot line as Breaking Bad.  It's about a suburban housewife who's husband dies and she needs to make more money so that her family can stay in her rich suburban neighborhood.  So she gets into the weed business.  And if you've watched drug scenarios before you'll know no one likes people invading their turf. I quit at one point around season 4.  But recently came back to it and finished it.  This is the ending scene of the series and I think it was perfect.

                        I watched this because of all the hype surrounding it.  People told me it was better than Game of Thrones.  SO I had to give it a shot.  It's good but not better than Game of Thrones. There's a lot of stuff happening, narrative loops, flashbacks, and it follows many characters.  This show has really opened up my eyes and mind to the world of AI.  I am beyond enthralled with the concept and want to learn more about it.  The show has major twists and turns, but most are pretty typical and follow common archetypes seen before.  In addition, this show really brings to question whether the audience can sympathize with robots.  The main problem I have with this show is I am unable to fully commit to their characters.  It's difficult to hook the audience when the majority of the characters that are worth sympathizing with are robots. I didn't shed a single tear even during the saddest moments. There's not really a character that the audience can root for, and that's critical in any show.  I found it difficult to attach and related to characters because they were robots.  A certain dehumanization of the characters created a slight wall between me and them.  But in the end, I was still able to sympathize for the robots.  My favorites are Maeve, Clementine, Delores, and Teddy.  The show also brought up a frightening aspect of how our world would treat AI robots (i.e How mindless raping and killing robots that look like humans was normal? And the limitations of our technological abilities and control over our creations).
