                <!--<h4>Being Mary Jane</h4>-->
                <p>Watched this show on a whim when I saw it on Netflix. Was a bit hesitant because I've never seen a BET drama before so I didn't really know what quality of story to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised that this show is so good.  Gabrielle Union stars as Mary Jane and is the epitome of a strong independent woman.  This picture is of her on her in show news brodcast</p>

            <!--<h4>Bloodline</h4>-->
            <p>This show is a Netflix original so I gave it a chance. A really slow burn.  Things don't really get super intense till the end of the season(s).  But I think it was well worth it in the end.  This picture is of Meg and John my favorite siblings/characters.</p>

                <!--<h4>Breaking Bad</h4>-->
                <p>Watched this show because my cousin recommended it to me.  Fell immediately in love with it.  I love shows about drugs/crime for some reason..  If you don't know what Breaking Bad is about, well... it's about a high school chemistry teacher who finds out he's diagnosed with cancer and has a short limited amount of time left.  His family isn't in the best of terms financially so he wants to try to build a savings so that they'll be okay when he's gone.  So he goes into the meth business and the story just takes off.  This picture is of my heart and soul, Jesse Pinkman and Jane Margoulis.  Jesse is my child.  He's too precious and my absolute joy in this show.  I loved him with Jane the most.</p>

                <!--<h4>Chuck</h4>-->
                <p>I watched this a really long time ago.  I quit before the last season and I never really gotten back to completing it. It's about an average joe who is trying to find answers about his dead mother and ends up becoming some super spy agent. This picture is of Chuck and Sarah.</p>

                <!--<h4>Crazy Ex-Girlfiend</h4>-->
                <p>I watched this when I was bored and out of things to watch.  And that's exactly what this show is. This show is about Rebecca who is a super successful lawyer in NYC and she runs into her old high school boyfriend one day.  She picks up her entire life and moves to West Covina, CA where he now lives. It's a musical with all original songs but inspired by popular music.  It's another one of those shows you watch only when you're bored and don't really go out of your way to watch it.  This picture is of Rebecca and Valencia meeting in the grocery store for the first time.</p>

                <!--<h4>Daredevil</h4>-->
                <p>This is a Netflix original and Marvel, so of course I had to watch it. If you aren't familiar with Daredevil, he's a part of the Marvel Universe.  He's a blind human that fights crime. Season 1 was okay, I wasn't super crazy about it because I didn't really love any of the characters.  But Season 2 blew me out of the water.  Mainly because of this guy in this picture.  Frank Castle AKA The Punisher.  Can I just say I was really doubtful that I would like him because of Jon Bernthal's protrayl of Shane Walsh in TWD (WHO I HATED TO PIECES).  But Jon's some sort of amazing and gave this character such redeeming qualities and made me just love him.  I also love Elektra in season 2 and her relationship with Matt. </p>

                <!--<h4>Dexter</h4>-->
                <p>This show was also recommended by my cousin, and I remember watching it every Sunday right after Breaking Bad when they were still airing.  I love this show.  It's about a Miami PD Forensics Scientist who is also a serial killer. I just loved the kills and the mystery of the entire series.  He typically has one main villian/enemy each season so the crime isn't solved episode by episode like a lot of shows.  This picture is of the Morgan siblings, Dexter and Debra.  They are the best.</p>

                <!--<h4>Doctor Who</h4>-->
                <p>A long time ago I watched 1 episode of Doctor Who.  With the 9th doctor and Rose.  I hated it... Fast forward a few years I give it another shot but with the 11th and Amy Pond.  I decided to give it another try only because I had just finished Selfie and just loved Karen Gillan in it and I knew a lot of people loved her in this as well so I dove in.  If you aren't familiar with Doctor Who, the Doctor is basically some alien that time travels in a police box called the Tardis.  And he has a sonic screwdriver that can do things, I'm not too sure what exactly but it does some magic type things.  I adored 11 and Amy's relationship.  AND ANGELS OF MANHATTAN BROKE ME.  I BAWLED SO HARD OH GOSH.  My heart still hurts just thinking about it.  Those are the best shows in my book.  The ones that still make you feel pain whenever you think of them.  This picture is from Angels of Manhatten and of 11 and Amy being cute.</p>

                <!--<h4>Elementary</h4>-->
                <p>I first watched this when it came out. It was pretty recently after I went crazy for Sherlock after Sherlock BBC.  And it had Lucy Liu in it so you already knew that I'm in.  It definitely is a different vibe than BBC Sherlock.  I kinda got left behind in the dust after season 3 because I had too many shows to keep up with. This is Sherlock and Watson</p>

                <!--<h4>Empire</h4>-->
                <p>I constantly kept hearing great things about this show and I saw so many promos for it I finally gave it a shot.  It's about a family that owns a record company named Empire and of course there's family drama that follows.  So the woman in this picture is Cookie Lyon, and she went to jail for a crime and is back and wants her claim for her portion of it.  I still have to catch up on the latest season</p>

                <!--<h4>Faking It</h4>-->
                <p>A pretty typical MTV teen show that you only watch because you're bored. High school drama. But there's sort of a twist because the main character Amy is in love with her best friend Karma, and the school thinks they're dating so they fake it to be popular.  And stuff happens.  It got canceled.  This picture is of Karma and Amy and I don't really remember what was happening.</p>

                <!--<h4>Fear the Walking Dead</h4>-->
                <p>I watched this because I love the parent series, The Walking Dead.  And it has ADC in it so I was convinced enough.  It definitely is not TWD. It's more of the early stages/days of the zombie apocolypse and it gives a different persepective and vibe to the whole scenario.  I definitely don't love a lot of the characters like in TWD.  I only like Alycia so here's a picture of her.</p>

                <!--<h4>From Dusk Till Dawn</h4>-->
                <p>Watched this because I saw it was new to Netflix and I was bored so I gave it a shot.  I was not expecting the vampire aspect to this show at all. If you're not familiar with From Dusk Till Dawn, it's loosley based off the movie with the same title.  And it follows the Gecko brothers, Seth and Richy.  Then stuff just happens because they're criminals and there's vampires.  This is a picture of the pilot where the Gecko bros fuck shit up. Still haven't caught up with anything after season 2 episode 1..  But I do miss DJ Cortona's pretty ass face.</p>

                <p>This is a spinoff the original Full House which I watched a ton of when I was younger. So of course I watched this for the nostalgia.  It's alright, it'll give you some feels and that's all that matters I guess. This is a pic from the first ep with all the old cast (-olsons).</p>

                <!--<h4>Game of Thrones</h4>-->
                <p>If you know me, you'd know this show is my pride and joy right now.  I actually started watching this really late; when they just finished season 4.  It rips me to shreds that I wasn't in the fandom when Red Weddding happened. So if you live under a rock and don't know what Game of Thrones is.  It's a fantasy drama that is based of ASOIAF series written by GRRM.  It's the most amazing show out right now.  That's in terms of production level/value, story, and magnificent cast of actors.  I am a Targaryen through and through. I have the house banner, giant posters of Dany and Jon, and all my pop figurines are Targs.  I want Dany on the throne in the end of course, but I'm very hesitant because all my favorite characters generally die.
                I am also a big fan of House Stark. Actually I only love 3 Starks.  Arya, Sansa, and Robb. And Jon if you wanna count him. This is a picture of the Mother of Dragons, Dany and her baby Drogon.

                <!--<h4>Gilmore Girls</h4>-->
                <p>This is one of those shows that I've always seen on TV as a kid and I've watched random snippets of it here and there when I was bored but I never really delved into it.  So I finally watched this when I was in 6th grade or in middle school. And I fell in love with it immediately.  It's about a single parent mom and her daughter, and how she has to rekindle her estranged relationship with her parents in order to put her daughter through private school and college.  The relationships are beautiful and dynamic, and you can truly feel the characters.  It takes place in a small town which also adds another element to the show.
                It's a really feel good show, it has it's laughs and sad moments. This is a picture of Rory and Logan.  My OTP of this show.  Ending destroyed me.  Look how cute they are.  I literally hate all the other boys she was with lol.  I'm super excited for the reboot and seeing where everyone ends up.

                <!--<h4>Gilmore Girls</h4>-->
                <p>
                    Okay so there's no fucking way I'm listing Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life under the original Gilmore Girls.  THEY DESTROYED AND RUINED EVERYTHING.  It had it's moments but most of it I wished didn't happen.. Good things were: Logan got the most screen time out of all of Rory's boys.  Logan and Rory had beautiful moments. Logan calls Rory Ace still. Emily Gilmore is a badass.  Richard Gilmore tributes tugged my heart. Bad: Tossed out everything that Rory and Logan stood for in the original series.  Logan would never reduce Rory to a side chick. The Logan in the original stood up for her even against his own family from the start.  There's no way he would just roll over and agree to an arranged marriage for his family.  I don't like how they made Rory pregant in the end.  That just ruins everything.  Why would they go to all this work to make Rory like Lorelai?  She's not. I'm not sure if I want another season and give them a chance to fix things or I can just pretend it never happened. This picture is of Rory and Logan of course.  It was my favorite scene and episode.  Fall.  The life and death brigade were back at it again. Everything was beautiful.

                <p>
                    At some point in my life this show was my love and joy in the world.  It's about a high school glee club and their drama.  I did quit after season 3 since my favorite character left.  I love this cast dearly and they'll always have a special place in my heart.  This is the Unholy Trinity.  That girl in the middle is Quinn Fabray, my most favorite ever.  HBIC.  The writers destroyed her and that makes me sad, but she escaped before the show ended.  I ship her with like everyone except people in the later seasons.  Faberry, Quinntana, Quick, Fuinn. YOU NAME IT.

                <p>
                    I watched this because I was bored and it was on Netflix.  It's about a group of rich kids living in the upper east side. There's this anonymous person taunting them with stories about them.  The ending is super bad because the show was dragged out too long.  I hate the Humphreys, DAN, JENNY, AND THEIR DAD.  This is Chair, Chuck and Blair.  They are the best.

It shows the uprising of the villians, Jim Gordon and of Batman in Gotham.  I love Jerome this guy right here.  But also Jim, Barbra, Selina, Nygma, Bruce, Penguin.  BASICALLY EVERYONE OKAY.

                <p>
                    Watched this because I saw ads for it on USA.  It's about a group of federal agents that live together in a house.  There's people from FBI, DEA, and ICE. And just the drama/crime with that.  It's pretty good.  It got canceled after the 3rd season, which I've yet to watch.  This is Paige and Mike.

I love Cristina, Meredith, and Derek.  The whole person concept that the Twisted Sisters have is the best thing in the world.  I am caught up with the show still and can't wait for the next season.

                    Watched this because the first episode was free on iTunes.  I got it and watched it.  I loved the camera work and how it was shot.  It's based off Hannibal Lector from Silence of the Lambs.  He's cooking sequences are freaking stunning. Great amount of gore and bloody kills too.  This is him in his kitchen.

                    I tried to watch this once but I couldn't get into a boring political show.  I tried it again like a year after and I loved it.  It's very smart with their power play/scheming.  I love when Frank breaks the 4th wall.  Kevin Spacey was born for this role and he's now one of my favorite actors now because of this.  This is Frank and Claire smoking. OTP

So I was 150% sold on watching this.  I love it dearly.  It's about a private investegator who has super strength and is being tormented by a man who uses mind control.  Trish and Jessica's relationship is one of the most beautiful things in this world.  This is a picture of Jessica smiling, but don't let it fool you because it does not happen often.

It's about a computer hacker and how he uses his skills to take down the corruption in society.  It's very accurate in it's hacking and computer concepts.  Amazing writing and acting.

It's based off the drug king Pablo Escobar.  Here he is with his money.

I hate almost all the main characters.  I only like Regina.  Emma, Henry, Charming, and Snow White and all their other family are extremely irritating.  So I quit around season 3.  I do like Jefferson and Red though but they are rarely in the show.  Here's the beautiful Sebastian Stan playing Jefferson.

It's about a group of high school kids and their journey to adulthood and finding themselves.  It's weird because as a kid I always liked Lucas and Peyton but when I watched it when I was older I liked Lucas and Brooke more..so here's a picture of them lol.  And one scene that I vividly remember as a kid was the one where Nathan is standing in the rain with Haley saying things about getting pnemonia.

It's about a family and their problems with Autism, adoption, affairs, and just about anything you can think of that happens in families.  I remember at one point I was crying each week because of the episodes.  They really know how to get to your emotions.  This is Team Braverman in the finale.

                    I remeber watching a random episode on ABC family one day because they had a marathon for it.  It was pretty good so I decided to start from the beginning and catch up.  It's about a group of girls who's friend died and an anonymous person named A is tormenting them.  I felt they were beating a dead horse.  The series/plot has been dragged out too long.  Thankfully they announced that the next season will be their last becaues it should have ended a while ago.  This is Hannah and Emily my faves, mostly because of Buttah Benzo.

                    Thinking about this show makes me cry.  I watched this because I saw a gif on tumblr of Mary and Francis in Season 1 Episode 2, and I remember thinking who the hell are these beautiful ass people?? And then I found the show that they were from and watched it.  It was a bit uneasy to me hearing modern music with this historical drama.  But after a while I kind of liked it.  It's about Mary Queen of Scots and her life.  It's not that historically accurate so if you're into that this probably isn't for you.  I love Frary to death. THEY BREAK MY HEART. OTP FOR LIFE.

                   So I saw this show during the fall season of new shows and it sounded interesting so I gave it a shot.  It's essentially a modern day version of My Fair Lady.  Basically a girl is crazy obsessed wtih social media and is pretty self-centered so a guy tries to teach her how to not be.  It makes me so sad/angry that this show got axed after 1 season.  It had soooo much potential. This is Henry and Eliza.  They make me cry.

I found Martin Freeman in this show to be super annoying so I don't ship Johnlock like 90% of tumblr does.  I liked Irene and Sherlock's relationship a lot more.  The thing I liked most is probably how they depict Sherlock's thought process while he solves the mystery.

It's about a show of misfit teens and their mischiefs.  I love Effy and Cook.  I wasn't a huge fan of the way they ended things.  And I was super bummed they didn't have a Effy and Cook interaction in Fire or Rise.

I love love love Clark and Lana together. CLANA FOR LIFE.  THIS SCENE RIGHT HERE BREAKS MY HEART AND I CRY EVERY TIME I WATCH IT.  If you ship Clois please don't talk to me I hate them so much.  They had -235925 chemistry in this show.  Maybe I'm dumb for shipping something that's not canon in the comics but THEIR LOVE WAS REAL.

                   I saw Adam Brody randomly in an interview on Youtube and he hasn't been in anything in a while so I checked it out.  He was promoting this show.  I was a bit conflicted with whether or not I wanted to watch it because it also had Martin Freeman in it.  And it is a tech and drug and crime drama.  So everything I love in one.  This is a prime example of how love can trump hate.  Because I still watched this show despite hating that fucking actor.  It was really good because he actually wasn't that annoying.  It's about a cryptocurrency startup and their journey to get funded.  It's a whole roller coaster and there are so many twists it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a pic of Nick played by Adam Brody.

                   This is a Netflix original.  It was super hyped up so I was expecting really great things from it.  But that didn't really happen.  It moved really slow for me, and was only semi-redemptive near the last 3 episodes.  It's about a kid that gets lost in some other dimension. I don't really get why people are crazy about it.  It was probably only a 7/10 at best for me.  Maybe sci-fi isn't my thing.  This is a picture of the kids.  Dustin is my fave.  He's the cutest.

                   I watched the pilot when it first came out, but I never had a chance to keep up with it as I was always preoccupied with school and other shows.  And it wasn't amazing enough for me to make the effort to watch it.  But recently over winter break when I renewed my Netflix, season 1 was on it and I saw a lot of gifs of Lena Luthor so I was like okay I gotta see what all this fuss is about.  AND OH MY GOD. THIS IS LENA LUTHOR. She should be a main cast member jfc.  I don't know how anyone even ships Kara/Supergirl with anyone else but her. EVERYTIME THEY ARE ON SCREEN TOGETHER IT'S SO GAY.

                <p>
                   I tried to watch this show a few years ago and I hated it.  I only got 15 minutes in before I had to quit.  The acting and line delivery was extremely cringy.  I couldn't take it.  And there was no star actor to keep me in, they were all new faces.  I came back to try it maybe 1-2 years after since it was on Netflix and I was bored.  I gave it another shot and it actually got better.  After the first few episodes things actually start happening and picking up.  It's about a post-apocalyptic society where they live on a huge spaceship but they are running out of resources.  So they send 100 juvenile delinquents to Earth to see if it is liveable again.  This is Raven my favorite.

She's the good wife because her husband cheated on her and she stood by him and he's campaigning for public office.  This is Will and Alicia.  They make me cry too. I'm so broken over them.

The first few episodes seemed a bit trashy but I was captivated for some reason.  It's about a modern British Monarchy.  So there's a lot of power play and scheming happening.  Princess Eleanor is my favorite.  Something about how broken she is just resonates with me. This is Jasper and Eleanor giving a Fight Club scene.  I used to really hate Jasper but I started liking him and shipping him with her in season 2.  THEY MAKE ME CRY TOO.

They like never write in their diaries ever again after season 1 so don't expect any of that.  This is Stelena.  Stefan and Elena.  They are my OTP 4 LIFE.  I don't understand why people like her with Damon. I just don't see it.  The scene where Stefan calls Elena on her birthday ruins me every single time I watch it.

                   I watched this because I was bored.  I'm still only on season 1.  This show is about vampires and humans living in the same world.  There's a lot of problems between the two species.  It reminds me of the X-men  human and mutant relationship. That's funny because Ann Paquin is in both.  SO this picture is from the finale and it's a super spoiler for myself so haha.

                   I watched this because it won Emmys. I'm not too keen on comedies, but this show manages to make me laugh.  It's about the vice president of the united states, and they poke fun at politics.  It helps that the main character has the same name as you. Also JLD is absolute gold.  This is a random picture since I wasn't too sure which to put.

                   I watched this because it was on Netflix and I was bored.  It's a pretty similar plot line as Breaking Bad.  It's about a suburban housewife who's husband dies and she needs to make more money so that her family can stay in her rich suburban neighborhood.  So she gets into the weed business.  And if you've watched drug scenarios before you'll know no one likes people invading their turf. I quit at one point around season 4.  But recently came back to it and finished it.  This is the ending scene of the series and I think it was perfect.

                    I watched this because of all the hype surrounding it.  People told me it was better than Game of Thrones.  SO I had to give it a shot.  It's good but not better than Game of Thrones. There's a lot of stuff happening, narrative loops, flashbacks, and it follows many characters.  This show is about a futuristic world where there's a theme park named Westworld where people can come and live life without limits. The theme park is maintained by a bunch of staff and creators who write narratives for each host.  A host is essentially a robot constructed to look like humans, and they are programmed to their own certain narratives.  This show has really opened up my eyes and mind to the world of AI.  I am beyond enthralled with the concept and want to learn more about it.  The show has major twists and turns, but most are pretty typical and follow common archetypes seen before.  In addition, this show really brings to question whether the audience can sympathize with robots.  The main problem I have with this show is I am unable to fully commit to their characters.  It's difficult to hook the audience when the majority of the characters that are worth sympathizing with are robots. I didn't shed a single tear even during the saddest moments. There's not really a character that the audience can root for, and that's critical in any show.  I hold Game of Thrones to a very very high standard, but even if I didn't I feel Westworld falls short of it.  However, their cast is every bit as amazing. They have the beautiful James Marsden. This is Dolores with flies on her hahahha
